What are two of your strong points?
I believe my strongest sides are communication and teamwork. 


Do you have examples of this?

I was involved in a lot of group activities in my previous education, where teamwork and good communication and understanding between collegues was essential. 
How is this point shown in a team?

Listening to ideas, trying to understand a different point of view, making group decisions, not being afraid to contribute by suggesting ideas/asking for help if stuck.

What are two of your weaker points?
I have very little background in programming, so regarding to this particular project my weakest sides are actually writing the code and understanding how different systems work together(frameworks, libraries, git, etc.)

Do you have examples of this?
Exam grades represent that well. 

How is this point shown in a team?
This will show in my incomprehension of code of other people and it will be time consuming for them to try to explain a lot of things to me. 

G - Goal

What is your learning goal during this course?
I believe I do not need to improve my interpersonal skills that much, therefore my main goal of this course is to deepen my knowledge in alround programming. 
Do you have multiple? List them separately.
-Improve my skills on Java
-Become better at Git
-Understand how softwares are developed. 


Why is this important to you?
It is part of the set of skills a computer scientist should have, so this is highly useful in one's career.

When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?
I could claim that this a never-ending process, although I would like to be well equipped with these skills by the end of this course. 


R - Reality (Your current situation)

Are you actively working on your goal?
I will be trying to do as much work as possible to achieve my goals.
What is going well?
I can concentrate for long periods of time and I almost never leave work unfinished and this quality will help me in consistently upgrading the skills mentioned above.


O - Options (Look at possible options)

What are options you have to achieve your goal?
The hands-on experience of this project will surely upgrade my skills. Learning from better programmers in my team is also very important.
Which option do you want to use the most?
A combination of self-learning from 'Google', 'Stackoverflow' and asking my team for help.
What is stopping you reaching your goal?
Division of time between my personal life and no-life nature of this study.

W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)

What are you going to do to reach your goal?
Try to spend every bit of time I can to devote for the study to research this subject, try to program as much as possible and have a hands-on experience. 
What is the first concrete step you can take RIGHT NOW?
Research Java libraries, see what I could be using in my code, re-read the slides from the lecture and learn Git commands. 

How can your teammates help you achieve this goal?
By contributing to analysis of the problem I encounter, directing me to the answer or actually teaching me/explaining the solution. 

Can you make an action plan with concrete steps to help you achieve your goal?
Every week the sprint plan will be made, which will inevitably have
