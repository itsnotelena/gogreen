# Personal Development plan

## Step 1: Develop a goal
My strong points are working with git and knowing how to code in java,
I can show this in a team by helping other if they have problems with this.

My weaker points are communication and teamwork.
I have never made a programming project with a larger group so I want to learn how to properly do that.

Core quadrant is as far as I understand it about natural qualities, not learned ones so this doesn't apply to my goals.

## Step 2: Create plan to achieve your goal
### Goals
    * Better teamwork
    * Better communication

This is important for me as I have little experience with larger programming projects.

I will hopefully have succeeded in this goal at the end of the project.

### Reality
I try to be proactive with issues and with planning. Communication is going well no issues so far.

We do need to divide the tasks better however this will probably happen in the near future.

### Options
* Be proactive in communication and ensure that I communicate my intentions well with others
* Try to help others if they get stuck on something
* Plan things together so I am on the same line as everyone else

Currently there are no things stopping me from reaching my goal.

### Will
I will do the things I outlined under "options". I will start with this immediately.

First concrete step is looking how Scrum works.

Teammates can help by also trying to work in a team and communicating well.
