Hello i'm Elena and here's my personal statement. 

Step 1 

My two strong points are : communication and open-minded. I get along with people. 
For me communication is important because it creates a positive study/workplace environment.  

My two weak points are : creativity and programming(lack of experience)
I had no prior knowledge about coding before coming here at TU Delft and I want to be on the same level as the others and hopefully I can catch up fast. 
It’s important for me because I want everyone in my group to pass and get a good grade. 

Can you make a core quadrant of this? No 
	
Step 2 

G - Goal
What is your learning goal during this course?
My learning goal during this course is improving my programmings skills and work efficiently in a teamwork.
It's important to me because it’s two fundamental skills for a computer science student and also in the workplace. 
I would hopefully achieve this goal during the project processing and have a better programming knowledge after the project achievement. 

R - Reality 
I haven't started coding for the project as I’m just writing my personal statement 
We get along so far with my teammates so it's a good beginning. 

O - Options 
I do not have a lot of options in my case in order to achieve my goal I need to practise "coding" a lot and work with my teammates. 
 

W - Will 
To achieve my goal I will work hard. But first I need to understand and get familiar with GitLab and Scrum.
