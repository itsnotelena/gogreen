# Personal Development Plan

## Step 1: Develop a goal
* *What are two of your strong points? Do you have examples of this? How is this point shown in a team?*

I have good analytical skills and I am quick to grasp new concepts, which I learned by participating in all sorts of mathematical competitions in high school. I can help the team by identifying problems and helping in finding solutions in an efficient matter.

* *What are two of your weaker points?
Do you have examples of this?
How is this point shown in a team?*

I sometimes find myself too comfortable w.r.t deadlines (I finished almost all projects in the week before the deadline this year) and also I lack the experience for this sort of project.

## Step 2: Create a plan to achieve your goal
### G - Goal

* *What is your learning goal during this course?
Do you have multiple? List them separately
Make sure your learning goal is concrete.*

I want to learn more about working in a team, communicating, meeting deadlines, sticking to an agenda and acquiring experience in developing a project.

* *Why is this important to you*

I believe these are critical skills that I will rely on later on.

* *When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?*

Hopefully, I will have succeeded by the end of this project.

### R - Reality (Your current situation)

* *Are you actively working on your goal?*

Since I am currently working with our team in developing this project, I believe I do.

* *What is going well?*

So far everything seems to be on track. Communication with the team is going well and it looks like teamwork won't be an issue.

* *What can use improvement?*

I believe that there is always room for improvement in almost anything and hopefully the team can learn a lot of things from each other.

### O - Options (Look at possible options)

* *What are the options you have to achieve your goal?*

Since my goal relates to every aspect of developing a  project I believe the only way to achieve my goal is to really get involved in the process and make sure that I actually learn something from it.


* *What is stopping you reaching your goal?*

Right now I can't think of anything that can stop me from reaching this goal except myself. Hopefully, that won't happen.

### W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)

* *What are you going to do to reach your goal?*

Communicate well with my team. Make sure that everybody is on the same wavelength. Research different approaches to problems we encounter during the project.

* *When are you going to do this?*

Ideally, I will be doing this almost constantly for the next 8 weeks.

* *What is the first concrete step you can take RIGHT NOW?*

Familiarize myself with the basics of project development.

* *How can your teammates help you achieve this goal?*

It goes without saying that we should work as a team. Other than that, anything they do to help me is greatly appreciated.
