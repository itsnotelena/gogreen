11 March meeting

What we have so far:
Server :
We have the sign up working, we need to figure out how to authenticate a user from the database so they can log in to the client with their credentials.
This will be done with sending tokens to the server from the client. From there we can easily create LOG with information about the user, and calculate points on their request.

GUI:
The design looks good, some tweaks needed (i.e. solar panel enabled button). Need to work on what happens when the client doesn't use the app for some time (colors dissolve?)


Reminded everyone about the checkstyle and tests. 

For next time we need to have the button implemented, client connected to the database.
