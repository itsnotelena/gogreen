## 18 March 

* Sprint review
* Decide on how the user is going to add friends and view them
    * Also decide on how the user will compare his/her points with his/her friends
* Decide on how are we going to award points.
* Should we store the points as a separate column in the database for each category or read them from the log table?
    * Same applies for how we should store badges, in a separate column/table or read them from the log?  
* Sprint plan
