Sprint review March 04

-Multiple members were too late
During the lab, some people were late. As our meeting times change, we decided to inform each other better.

-Progress of the application
We have clear ideas of the functionality of the application, the GUI is being improved and the database is connected to the server. 

-We reached our week goals, although we need to aim to use git more often to be able to see what the team members are up to.
