## Sprint review

* Everything we set out to do from the previous plan was done on time for the demo.

* One of the problems encountered was that some team members didn't have enough to do during the week. In order to fix this, we split the tasks between us as evenly as possible.

* Another issue that we have addressed is the lack of activity on gitlab. To solve this we will all get more involved in discussions on merge requests and things like that.
